>[**View my Project on GitHub - HERE**](https://github.com/KellyT4425/Croke-Park.git) <br>
[**Deploy Website - HERE**](https://kellyt4425.github.io/Croke-Park/) 




## **Project Description**
This project is aimed at providing users with an informative website that allows them to find out information on Croke Park Stadium, and what makes the home of GAA so special with its famous **atmosphere** and **unique** voluntary community. The communtiy that surrounds Gaelic Football is based off of dedication and a pure love for the sport. The players, managers and coaches recieve no reward for their time and effort, there only goal is to play the game they and their supporters are so passionate about and win the All-Irelands. 
<br>
<br>
The website is also aimed at providing users detailed options to tour the grounds of Croke Park along with its Museum and its stunning Skyline panorama which can be seen 17 stories up. An option to also enquire about gift vouchers is available for those who want to gift a friend or loved one to the spectaular sight that is Croke Park. A **CTA** page was also included that allows users to reach out, or find out more about the tours and all Croke Park has to offer. 

### **Technology Stack**
This Project used various technologies to make it presentable, functional and user friendly.<br>
<br> **Frontend Framework**
>HTML 5<br>
>CSS 3<br>
>Bootstrap v5.3 

## **Styling**

### **Typography**
Two font families where selected to add style to the project, DM Sans, serif was picked for the body of the content and Goldman, serif was picked for all headings. [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to refine my search for the kind of style I felt would be suited to the over all presentation of the project which would go with the theme and also visually appealing to user's. <br>
>font-family: <br>"DM Sans", serif; <br>
<br>

>font-family: <br>"Goldman", serif;

### **Colour Scheme**

[**Canva**](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) colour palette generator was used to select the colour scheme, the background image of the websites contact page was used to allow *Canva* to generate colours which would match the colours in imagery.

### **Imagery**
[**Adobe Express**](https://new.express.adobe.com/) was used to edit images, mostly for pixels and resolution especially for responsing to responsive design. All images used for the website can be found in images folder attached in the respository.
>[**Font Awesome**](https://fontawesome.com/) was used to provide the website's icons and favicon



### **Wireframes**
In the preparation stage of this project wireframes where created to provide visual aid to how the website should look and what features and functions it should have in order to meet its purpose.
