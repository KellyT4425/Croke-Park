[**Deploy Website - HERE**](https://kellyt4425.github.io/Croke-Park/) 




## **Project Description**
<p>This project is aimed at providing users with an informative website that allows them to find out information on Croke Park Stadium, and what makes the home of GAA so special with its famous <strong>atmosphere</strong> and <strong>unique</strong> voluntary community. The communtiy that surrounds Gaelic Football is based off of dedication and a pure love for the sport. The players, managers and coaches recieve no reward for their time and effort, there only goal is to play the game they and their supporters are so passionate about and win the All-Irelands.</p>

<p>The website is also aimed at providing users detailed options to tour the grounds of Croke Park along with its Museum and its stunning Skyline panorama which can be seen 17 stories up. An option to also enquire about gift vouchers is available for those who want to gift a friend or loved one to the spectaular sight that is Croke Park. A **CTA** page was also included that allows users to reach out, or find out more about the tours and all Croke Park has to offer.</p>

### **Technology Stack**
This Project used various technologies to make it presentable, functional and user friendly.<br>
<br> **Frontend Framework**
>HTML 5<br>
>CSS 3<br>
>Bootstrap v5.3 

## **Styling**

### **Typography**
Two font families where selected to add style to the project, DM Sans, serif was picked for the body of the content and Goldman, serif was picked for all headings. [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to refine my search for the kind of style I felt would be suited to the over all presentation of the project which would go with the theme and also visually appealing to user's. <br>
>font-family: <br>"DM Sans", serif; <br>
<br>

>font-family: <br>"Goldman", serif;

### **Colour Scheme**

[**Canva**](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) colour palette generator was used to select the colour scheme, the background image of the websites contact page was used to allow *Canva* to generate colours which would match the colours in imagery.

### **Imagery**
[**Adobe Express**](https://new.express.adobe.com/) was used to edit images, mostly for pixels and resolution especially for responsing to responsive design. All images used for the website can be found in images folder attached in the respository.
>[**Font Awesome**](https://fontawesome.com/) was used to provide the website's icons and favicon


### **Wireframes**
In the preparation stage of this project wireframes where created to provide visual aid to how the website should look and what features and functions it should have in order to meet its purpose. [**Balsamiq**](https://balsamiq.com/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAy8K8BhCZARIsAKJ8sfTQzFLDPDxMbsgk-9un-aJDk1xvFlZdENGLQvV-c8Qv2NDKX6_d-T0aAjBaEALw_wcB) was used to create the below wireframes.

## **Testing and Validation**

1. **HTML 5 and CSS 3 Validators** where used to check for any coding errors. 

[HTML 5 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) 



While validating the tours page, in the HTML 5 Validator I came accross errors which where not visable on reviewing the html code. The home page and contact page came bad free of errors.
 
![HTML Validator](assets\images\tour-page-validator.png)
 
[**CSS3 Valitdator**](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) 
No errors where found while validating the CSS Stylesheet.


2. Chrome Dev Tools and its Lighthouse Tool for Analysing website **performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO**. Responsive design for all device sizes was also tested in Chrome Dev Tools.

3. [**WAVE**](https://wave.webaim.org/) web accessibility evaluation tool was also used to check that the web content was accessible to individuals with disabilities. 

4. Website navigation was also tested by ensuring all anchors/navigation links are responsive and working. Images, video's where given an alternative text and that it displays if an image or video does not load.

5. Contact form was also tested, to ensure adequate information is required to submit the form and that the form is submittable.

## **Bugs**

### Unsolved Bugs 
* **Navigation** <br>
Throughout the project I found that my nav toggle label pulls to the left on the home page and contact page, when using mobile dimensions. I have attempted to rectify this on numberious occasions but to no avail. I feel that at this time I currently lack the necessary skills required and as I progress and widen my knowledge I plan to revisit and fix any bugs that I was unable to resolve at this time. I also found that the navigation links on tablet and up move off position, rising and lowering on different screen widths. <br>

* **Tour Cards/Responsive Design** 
When adding the cards on the tour page, a [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/) component was used along with adding rules for Column Size and Spacing to the code within the HTML file, such as for example <em>sm-col-6, md-col-6</em>. I have found Bootstrap difficult to work with as a beginner but as my learning continues and my knowledge grows I intend to return and rectify any bugs and errors. Especially in relation to media queries.  


## **Future Features** 

### Contact Page Form
On submitting the form on the contact page, it navigates to a new page acknowledging submission and thanking the user for there enquiry.
