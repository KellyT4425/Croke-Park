        <p>
          The colour, passion and atmosphere that engulfs the stadium over the
          summer months is only matched by the dedication, skill and athleticism
          of players on the pitch. This is all the more impressive, as the GAA
          has remained an amateur association since its foundation.

        <p>
          The stadium symbolises what can be achieved when a cohesive volunteer
          force, work towards a common goal. Rooted not just in the community
          around the stadium, Croke Park on match day represents a culmination
          of months and even years of hard work, dedication and commitment to
          local life and sport for over 2,200 clubs in all 32 counties of
          Ireland.
        </p>

        <p>
          This volunteer ethos, which remains one of the most important aspects
          of the GAA, is carried throughout the stadium with teams of dedicated
          volunteers operating on match days and during special events to help
          ensure the safety and enjoyment of all patrons.
