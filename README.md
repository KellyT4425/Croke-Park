### **Typography**
Two font families where selected to add style to the project, DM Sans, serif was picked for the body of the content and Goldman, serif was picked for all headings. [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to refine my search for the kind of style I felt would be suited to the over all presentation of the project which would go with the theme and also visually appealing to user's. <br>
>font-family: <br>"DM Sans", serif; <br>
